# Bio

I am a statistician and methodologist working as a Scientific Advisor for [GEMINI Research](https://geminimedicine.ca/) at Unity Health Toronto. I am also an Adjunct Lecturer in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation (IHPME) at the University of Toronto. I specialize in Bayesian methods and causal inference for medical research. My recent work has focused on applying Bayesian borrowing to address the challenges of evaluating efficacy/effectiveness in rare disease settings. I have extensive experience in health economics & outcomes research (HEOR) analytics with expertise in meta-analysis, survival modelling, synthetic control arms, and population-adjusted indirect comparisons.

Prior to joining GEMINI, I worked as a Scientific Advisor in Statistics and independent consultant for Inka Health. Before that I worked for 4 years at Cytel in the Real World & Advanced Analytics group where I rose to the role of Research Principal in Statistics. I also have prior experience working in an economics setting, including 2 years in the Antitrust & Competition Economics practice at Charles River Associates applying statistical/econometric methods for regulatory reviews of mergers and acquisitions.

I hold an MSc in Statistics from the University of Toronto and an MA in Economics from Queen's University. I also have Professional Statistician (P.Stat.) accreditation from the Statistical Society of Canada.

For a recent perspective on evaluating treatments for rare indications and the benefits of a Bayesian approach, [see here for an article I co-authored](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1249611/full).
