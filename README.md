# Bio

I am a scientific advisor in statistics and founding member at Inka Health. I specialize in Bayesian methods and causal inference for medical research. My recent work has focused on applying Bayesian borrowing to address the challenges of evaluating efficacy/effectiveness in rare disease settings. I have extensive experience in health economics & outcomes research (HEOR) analytics with expertise in meta-analysis, survival modelling, synthetic control arms, and population-adjusted indirect comparisons.
